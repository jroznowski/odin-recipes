    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Skip the drive-thru and make irresistible seasoned fries at home. This seasoned French fry recipe creates fries that are crispy on the outside, but fluffy and tender on the inside.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potatoes into fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350F (or 175C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic and onion salt, paprika and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry, dip into batter one at a time.</li>
        <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy for about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
